### Project Name

This is my phase 1 final project. The webstie/project name will be "Gaming Library"

### Website Purpose

A personal library is something some people like to show off. "Hey look at all these books I've read!", the website is meant to be the same but with games! My goals for this website are to have a few cool fetures.
